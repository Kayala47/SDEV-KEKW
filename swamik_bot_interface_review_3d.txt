The component being reviewed during this session was the bot interface 
module, which details the specification, design, and testing procedures 
for the system responsible for handling user inputs and passing back messages to 
the user. 

Must Fix: 

- Defect: The bot cannot handle the case when the call to the roll function is not spaced 
    - The user should not be expected to put spaces: 1d20 + 5 should be the same as 1d20+5
    - the code structure cannot handle that

-Defect: The bot cannot handel negative modifiers 
    - it was brought up that negative modifiers are used in most TTRPGs 
    - The current logic for the reading the inputs for the roll command cannot handel this

-Defect: Cannot test the bot interface indipendently 
    - this module is relient on the other modules for its testing 
    - A revised testing plan was suggested to allow for more individual testing 
    - creating a log of the results from the tests was suggested 
    - logging a message such as "call to multiroll was successful" would allow for more individual testing 

-Defect: No advantage or disadvantage rolling option 
    - This method was not present in the original architecture and got added 
    - Need to add another command in the bot interface design to impliment this funciton 

- Issue: No white box tests
    - There was not enough algorithmic intensity to warrent white box tests
    - A revised error handling structure for user inputs will justify white box testing 

- Issue: Need more testing clarity/ error handeling 
    - there needs to be more checks to the user inputs 
    - can give the users more specific feedback on what param of their input is wrong 
    - the specific error messages should be better outlined 
 
 -Issue: The initive tracker also needs to be passed the username of the user for the initive tracker 
    - currently the username is recognized but not passed 

-Issue: The prefixes are limited to the list provided
    - The issues arise if there are multiple bots that use the same prefix 
    - SHould not limit the user to predefined prefix list: allow users to make anything their prefix 

-Question: Does the emoji reaction for the initive tracker need to be a different function?
    - No, the emoji reaction is a part of the same function that initially returns the message to the user 
    - the emoji reaction feature, much like the bot listeing to the chat for specific commands, will only 
        listen to reactions made on the message that was sent. It is not a seperate function, just a part 
        of the original 

- Question: What is the default call to roll with no params
    - it will just call the default roll fucntion from the rolling module 


Should Fix: 

-Issue: Manual Roll Formatting 
    - The manual roll should be formatted the same way as the regualr roll for consistency 

-Issue: The output for a messed up fudge roll attempt 
    - currently the bot does not return anything for a messed up fudge roll attempt 
        - done to not notifuy the other users that a fudge roll was attempted 
    - need to handel error cases better to better notify the user on the instructions for how to fudge roll 
        - possibly send a direct message to the user 

-Question: How are you spliting up the user message or passing the params to the other modules?
    - The creators of the other modules made it clear that they want the user inputs as is (meaning not split or tampered with)
    - the bot interface will only check that the inputs are in the correct format (ex: xdy + z)
        - will not check that x,y,z are ints, that check is handeled by the rolling module 



Comments: 

- Issue: Not readable formatting the result to the user 
    - the bot will only return the result from the other modules as is 
    - there needs to better formatting to make it easier for the user to read 

- Issue: Lack of explicit testing structure
    - Will use py unittest 

Based on the  report and the issues and defects raised during the meeting,
we decided to approve the project with the required changes. The largest issue
requiring an immediate fix is the handeling of user inputs. There needs to be more checks 
on the format of the command that the user is sending and error handeling for each case 
needs to be more specific. There are some commands missing from the bot interface as well. 
In the meeting, reasonable solutions for these issues were suggested, and so we believe that the
project will be ready after handling those shortcomings.
