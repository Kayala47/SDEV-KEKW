Notes for Code Review of Rolling Component


ROLLING.PY
- I really liked your error handling, definitely gave me a good 
example to use for my own component 
- the comment for dbError isn't helpful. Maybe consider the first line 
to be something like "Returns an error indicating incorrect access of 
macro database"
- rollAdv is efficient because you'll usually be rolling 1d20's, but there 
are a few scenarios where you get to re-roll certain other dice. I'm thinking 
a fighting style like Great Weapon Master lets you re-reroll your weapon die. 
I think we could potentially use this same command for it, if we had a way to 
tell it what nunmber it would use. Not a necessity, since this is a pretty clever 
way to do things
- should you have some error checking in macros in case you can't find the file?
- I really liked your setup, especially the comments at the beginning of each function




ROLLING TEST
- these tests look great!s
