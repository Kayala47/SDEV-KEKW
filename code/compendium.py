PURPOSE: 

The purpose of this module is to get information to our users
about rulesets that pertain to them. Specifically, we want to 
do this for free, which is a huge departure from the existing 
programs that do this. Furthermore, in the true spirit of D&D, 
we do it using the great wealth of information cultivated by 
players of the game in the form of the D&D wiki at
http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/
