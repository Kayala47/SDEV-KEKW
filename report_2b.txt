Must Fix 
- Defect: Prefix
    - The bot needs to allow people to change the prefix for bot commands.
    - ! is common for many bots, and trying to call one bot will call multiple if they 
    have overlapping commands. (eg. !help)

- Defect: Remove a song from the queue
    - There is currently no command that allows users to remove a song from the queue.

- Defect: Trolling 
    - The bot needs a way to prevent users from trolling, or messing with, the other listeners.
     (ie. by continuously pausing and playing a track, skipping forward through the whole queue 
     without listening to everyone’s songs, etc.)
    - Having a time constraint on how many commands one can make in a certain amount of time was 
    suggested.
    - Having a voting system for skipping songs could be implemented using emoji reactions for 
    release 2.0.

- Issue: Security/ Privacy
    - The bot has to handle confidential information correctly.
    - We do not want users to access other people’s song history without their confirmation, 
    because some users may want their privacy.
    - Emoji reactions were suggested as a means of accepting a potential query to use the 
    history comparison feature with friends.

- Hierarchy 
    - Creating one class to listen for commands in the Discord server which can access 
    the database of login information and call the other classes on a need-based basis was suggested.
    - This would also help with complexity, making it so the bot doesn’t have five classes 
    all listening unnecessarily to the text channels despite not all being needed at once.
    - This one listening component was also suggested to help with the “trolling” 
    problem, adding the command cooldown functionality.

- Defect: No DBMS selected 
    - There is a lot of information that the developers want to store, but they have not 
    selected their DBMS.
    - The DBMS needs to communicate with their Discord bot and possibly the Spotify API 
    and needs to be selected carefully.

Should Fix 
- Defect: Different queues if using the Spotify app to add songs
    - If a user decides to queue a song through the Spotify app using their personal account, 
    the user will be out of sync with the listening group.
    - The bot should be able to access the user queue from Spotify and sync with everyone 
    else’s Spotify queues by updating the listening party queue.

- Issue: Capitalization of commands  
    - The bot commands currently all start with a capital letter. (eg. !Spotify)
    - Users might not want to capitalize their letters, so the bot should allow users 
    to use lower case for their commands. (eg. !spotify)

Comments 
- Issue: The architecture approach is not outlined 
    - In the document, there should be a section where they outline the approach they will be using.
    - The document should also provide justification for their specific approach, which they 
    mentioned was a mixture of top-down and bottom-up.

- Issue: Conflicting Commands 
    - The developers are not expecting conflicting commands, except users trying to use listening 
    party commands where there is no listening party. In this situation, the bot will return an error 
    into the text channel.

- Question: Searching songs with the same names but different artists 
    - How will the bot deal with vague search queries?
    - A suggestion would be to allow users to add Spotify song links, to ensure their specific song 
    will be played in the queue instead of a song with the same name. These song links can be found 
    by right-clicking on the song, and navigating to “Share”; there’s a “Copy Song Link” button.

Based on the architecture report and the issues and defects raised during the meeting, we decided to 
approve the project with required changes. The main points in the must fix section are issues that deal 
with usability and security regarding user’s paid subscriptions. The other main issue is the lack of DBMS 
in their architecture. During the meeting, the group had plans on how to address all of these key issues, 
and from their responses they seemed reasonably easy to fix. For this reason, we believe that once these 
necessary changes are made, this project will be ready to be approved.
