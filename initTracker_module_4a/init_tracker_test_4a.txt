SPECIFICATIONS TO COVER
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- able to add a character to the initiative order (join)
- able to begin combat, which prints a representation of initiative order (begin)
- able to end combat, which clears the database (end)
- able to retrieve the details of next player in initiative order (next)
- able to retrieve the details of previous player in initiative order (prev)
- able to increment and decrement round based on "next" or "prev" (inc_round, dec_round)
- format will be acceptable for parsing

The plan for testing is to use a seperate class where running main will immediately
verify all test cases, and return which tests are broken.

For all testing purposes, we will be using Python unittest framework, as it is
straightforward with desired funtionality.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: join(username, name, initiative)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that the character is added to trackerInfo by checking that,
                    after join(username, name, initiative) is called, len(trackerInfo)
                    has increased by 1.
    Justification: Ensures that when users wish to add their character to the initiative
                   order, it reflects correctly in trackerInfo and in the initiative
                   order object stored by the bot interface.
    Special Set-Up: We need to create a list of usernames, names, and initiative values
                    to use as inputs.
    Generation: When join(username, name, initiative) is called.
    Correctness: We are expecting that the length of each of trackerInfo will increase by
                 one each time a new character joins the initiative order.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that the username, name, and initiative value of the character
                    being added match.
    Justification: Ensures that the usernames, names, and inits are all linked properly
                   across lists, and will show up correctly when displayed for the user.
    Special Set-Up: We need to create a list of usernames, names, and initiative values
                    to use as inputs.
    Generation: When join(username, name, inititative) is called.
    Correctness: We are expecting that when join(username, name, initiative) is called,
                 trackerInfo[currentPlayer] should hold [username, name, initiative]
                 matching the character just added.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 3: Assert that initiative is an integer.
    Justification: Ensures that database can be properly sorted.
    Special Set-Up: N/A
    Generation: When join(username, name, initiative) is called.
    Correctness: We are expecting that init is an integer. If not, we return an error
                 message.
    Clean-Up: N/A

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: begin()
    Testing Case 1: Assert that when trackerInfo has less than two combatants, an error
                    message is returned.
    Justification: A user shouldn't be able to begin combat if there are less than two
                   characters currently engaged in combat. If trackerInfo is empty, this
                   means that there are no active characters in combat. If trackerInfo has
                   one combatant, that character is lacking an adversary.
    Special Set-Up: We need to ensure trackerInfo starts this test empty, with one
                    combatant, and with two or more combatants.
    Generation: When begin() is called before users call join(username, name, initiative)
                through the bot interface via "!join name init".
    Correctness: We are expecting that if the database has less than two characters, an
                 error message is returned. Otherwise, begin() as normal.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Also testing printTracker()
    Testing Case 2: Assert that the full list of characters engaged in combat is returned
                    when begin() is called.
    Justification: Ensures that users can see the full initiative order, and prepare for
                   their turn.
    Special Set-Up: We need to create a list of usernames, names, and initiative values
                    to use as inputs.
    Generation: When begin() is called through the bot interface via "!begin".
    Correctness: We are expecting that all the characters in the list used for set-up are
                 returned.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Also testing printTracker()
    Testing Case 3: Assert that the characters are in the correct sorted order when they
                    are printed.
    Justification: Ensures that data is being correctly retrieved or stored in trackerInfo
                   so that the initiative tracker is complete.
    Special Set-Up: We need to create a list of usernames, names, and initiative values
                    to use as inputs.
    Generation: When begin() is called through the bot interface via "!begin".
    Correctness: We are expecting that the characters in the list used for set-up are
                 returned from highest to lowest initiative value.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: end()
    Testing Case 1: Assert that trackerInfo is cleared when end() is called.
    Justification: Ensures that trackerInfo is clear for the next session of combat, to clear
                   the board for new characters with new initiatives.
    Special Set-Up: trackerInfo needs to be filled with data.
    Generation: At the end of combat, when a user wants to end the combat session. Or, prior
                to joining a new combat encounter if a user has forgotten whether or not
                they had already previously ended combat for the last session. (For this
                reason, it is acceptable to end() when trackerInfo is empty.
    Correctness: We are expecting that trackerInfo is clear of data.
    Clean-Up: N/A

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: next()
    Testing Case 1: Assert that currentPlayer is increased by 1 if index isn't
                    len(trackerInfo) - 1.
    Justification: The index should increment when someone finishes their turn in combat.
    Special Set-Up: trackerInfo should have at least two characters.
    Generation: When a player finishes their turn and clicks the "next" emoji reaction
                on the bot interface.
    Correctness: We are expecting that when the currentPlayer, or index, is anywhere
                 before the last person in initiative order, or database length - 1, the
                 currentPlayer is increased by 1.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that currentPlayer is reset to 0 if index is len(trackerInfo)
                    - 1 when next() is called.
    Justification: The index should loop around to the top of the initiative order once
                   the last person in the list takes their turn.
    Special Set-Up: trackerInfo should have at least two characters.
    Generation: When a player finishes their turn and clicks the "next" emoji reaction
                at the end of a round.
    Correctness: We are expecting that when currentPlayer is at len(trackerInfo) - 1, it
                 gets reset to 0.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: prev()
    Testing Case 1: Assert that currentPlayer is decreased by 1 if index isn't 0.
    Justification: The index should decrement when someone retracts or revisits their
                   turn in combat.
    Special Set-Up: trackerInfo should have at least two characters.
    Generation: When a player finished their turn and clicks the "previous" emoji reaction
                on the bot interface.
    Correctness: We are expecting that when the currentPlayer, or index, is anywhere
                 after the first person in initiative order, or 0, the currentPlayer is
                 decreased by 1.
    Clean-Up: trackerInfo.clear(); currentPlayer = 0; rounds = 0

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that currentPlayer is reset to len(trackerInfo) - 1 if index is
                    0 when prev() is called.
    Justification: The index should loop back to the bottom of initiative order if they
                   rewind the combat order.
    Special Set-Up: The database should have at least two characters.
    Generation: When a player revisits their turn and clicks the "previous" emoji reaction
                on the bot interface when they are at the top of initiative order.
    Correctness: We are expecting that when currentPlayer is at 0, it gets reset to
                 database length - 1.
    Clean-Up: end()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: inc_round() via next()
    Testing Case 1: Assert that the round has been incremented by 1.
    Justification: Ensures that round is updated correctly when next() is called.
    Special Set-Up: next() working correctly; the database needs to be filled with at
                    least two characters, and next() needs to be looped until the current
                    player is back to index 0.
    Generation: When all players have taken their turn.
    Correctness: We are expecting that when all characters have been prompted and have
                 completed their turns, the round will increase by 1.
    Clean-Up: end()

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: dec_round() via prev()
    Testing Case 1: Assert that the round has been decremented by 1.
    Justification: Ensures that round is updated correctly when prev() is called.
    Special Set-Up: prev() working correctly; the database needs to be filled with at
                    least two characters, and prev() needs to be looped until the current
                    player is back to index database length - 1.
    Generation: When a turn needs to be revisited, for example if a user clicked next on
                accident.
    Correctness: We are expecting that if the current index is 0 and prev() is called, the
                 round will decrease by 1.
    Clean-Up: end()
