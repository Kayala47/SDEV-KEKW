PURPOSE
--------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this module is to cover the initiative
tracking requirements for common TTRPG games. The bot will
be able to use this module to add characters to the initiative
tracker with either a physically-rolled initiative or a
bot-rolled initiative, display the initiative order to the
text channel, keep track of rounds and the current turn, and
end combat by clearing the initiative tracker. This module
will be a class; the Bot Interface module will store an
instance of an initiative tracker, allowing persistent storage
of the tracker information.
--------------------------------------------------------------
CLASS ATTRIBUTES
--------------------------------------------------------------
trackerInfo
    A three-dimensional array arranged so trackerInfo[i][0]
    holds the usernames, trackerInfo[i][1] holds the character
    names, and trackerInfo[i][2] holds the initiative values.
    (Given i is some non-negative integer.)

currentPlayer
    An integer representing the index in trackerInfo that
    holds the current player's information. This is updated
    each time next() is called.

rounds
    An integer representing the number of combat rounds. This
    is updated when currentPlayer loops around trackerInfo,
    so that currentPlayer is once again 0.

FUNCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------
join(username, name, initiative)
    Possible Returns: none
    Inputs: username - string
            name - string
            initiative - int
    Logic: Append [username, name, init] to trackerInfo.
    Error Handling: Throws an error if initiative is non-int,
                    name already exists in the trackerInfo, or
                    if round != 0.
    Comments: This function is in charge of adding a character
              into the initiative order. The Dungeon Master
              can also add creatures in this way. It cannot be
              called once combat has begun via begin().

begin()
    Possible Returns: trackerInfo[currentPlayer]
    Inputs: none
    Logic: Sets round = 1, currentPlayer = 0, sorts
           trackerInfo by initiative value in descending
           order via sortTracker(), and calls printTracker().
           The current player information is returned to
           prompt the user via the bot interface.
    Error Handling: Throws an error if the database has less
                    than two entries in trackerInfo, or if
                    begin has already been called.
    Comments: This function marks the start of combat. Once
              it has been called, characters can no longer
              join combat.

end()
    Possible Returns: none
    Inputs: none
    Logic: Clear trackerInfo and sets currentPlayer = 0, and
           rounds = 0.
    Error Handling: Throws an error if trackerInfo isn't
                    empty after attempting to clear it.
    Comments: This should be called at the end of combat.

next()
    Possible Returns: trackerInfo[currentPlayer]
    Inputs: none
    Logic: If currentPlayer + 1 is an out of bounds index
           for trackerInfo, then currentPlayer = 0 and
           inc_round() is called. Otherwise, currentPlayer++.
           The details of the current player are returned. The
           printTracker() function is called.
    Error Handling: Throws an error if rounds == 0.

prev()
    Possible Returns: trackerInfo[currentPlayer]
    Inputs: none
    Logic: If currentPlayer - 1 is an out of bounds index
           for trackerInfo, then currentPlayer is set to
           len(trackerInfo) - 1. Otherwise, currentPlayer--.
           The details of the current player are returned, The
           printTracker() function is called.
    Error Handling: Throws an error if rounds == 0.

inc_round()
    Possible Returns: none
    Inputs: none
    Logic: Increments rounds by 1.
    Error Handling: N/A

dec_round()
    Possible Returns: none
    Inputs: none
    Logic: Decrements rounds by 1, unless doing so would
           result in rounds < 1.
    Error Handling: Throws error if rounds - 1 = 0.

sortTracker()
    Possible Returns: none
    Inputs: none
    Logic: Sorts trackerInfo by initiative value from highest
           to lowest.
    Error Handling: N/A

printTracker()
    Possible Returns: none
    Inputs: none
    Logic: Sends a message to the Discord server with a list
           representation of the initiative order, with the
           current character in bold.
