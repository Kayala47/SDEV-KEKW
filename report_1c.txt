OPEN-ENDED INFORMATION GATHERING
----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Roll20"
- lack of specialty features (Homebrew, Unearthed Arcana)
- importing character sheets isn't easy
- no way to keep track of monsters
- clunky, outdated, cluttered
- allows you to import battle maps
- good for players, bad for dungeon masters
- does math for you when rolling dice
- Has the general functionality but has an out of date feel 
- Good functionality is behind paywalls 

"Avrae"
- paywall for D&D Beyond content
- alias creation is confusing; people want to creatively engage with bots
- importing character sheets isn't easy
- dice rolling is good
- initiative tracking for combat is good, could be better
- ability to add NPCs into combat order is good
- compendium look-up is good for basic D&D content
- lack of specialty features (Homebrew, Unearthed Arcana)
- Lucas mentioned that this tool was difficult to use for those who did not have a coding background 


----------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

THOUGHTS ON PREVIOUSLY GATHERED REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
"Dice Rolling with Dungeon Master Fudging"
- affirmed by all panelists
- don't fudge player rolls (Justin)
- illusion of control is nice, so fudging player rolls could be interesting (Glen)
- make sure to disable notifications to ensure fudging isn't revealed
- delete command messages
- potentially allow manual input of dice rolls

"Enhanced Initiative Tracking"
- affirmed by all panelists
- allow manual input of dice rolls
- beware too many commands, hard to remember

"NPC Generation"
- useful for dungeon masters
- take NPCs from another source or online tool
- make sure NPCs can be used for a general situation
- potentially provide images of NPCs

"Compendium Look-Up"
- affirmed by all panelists
- hope that specialized features can be added and stored

"Map Generator"
- affirmed by all panelists
- interesting feature, helpful for dungeon masters
- saves time for dungeon master planning, and for theater of the mind
