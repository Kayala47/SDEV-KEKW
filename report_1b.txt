Avrae Discord Bot
-----------------
Features:
Dice rolling
Initiative tracking
Sync with DnDBeyond; character sheet integration
Compendium lookup
Some functionality for creating your own commands (aliasing python code)
Creates random characters
-----------------
Address user’s needs:
Dice roller is nice, but doesn’t allow for DM Fudging of the dice rolls. Our app will allow users with certain permissions to fudge dice rolls
Does not store characters for lookup later - depends entirely on DnDBeyond and CritterDB. Doesn’t allow for creation of unique things or storage & lookup later
-----------------
Done well:
LOTS of functionality - one stop shop
Connect to character sheets to prevent redundancy
-----------------
Not Done well:
Very little documentation for macros
Heavily dependent on other services, like DnDBeyond, which are paid
-----------------
Value:
Geared toward DM, not players. Supplementary to Avrae
New features like fudging, homebrew creation, etc
