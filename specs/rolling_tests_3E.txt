    Project: 3C - Testing Plan
    Primary Author: Max
    Slip Days: 0

SPECIFICATIONS TO COVER:
- able to roll with [dis]advantage
- able to roll traditional [x]d[y]+[z] format and inform player of results
- able to fudge a roll, faking the output of an [x]d[y]+[z] format roll
- able to manually input a roll, represented as an [x]d[y]+[z] format roll with specified output
- able to add an item macro to shared csv file with attributes, unless the item is already present (database)
- able to remove an item macro from the shared csv file, unless the item is not there (database)
- able to use an item macro as long as it exists in the csv file (database)
- return format will be a string acceptable for the bot to message in channel
(integration testing - will not be done here)

The plan for testing is to use a seperate class where running main will immediately verify all test cases,
and return which tests are broken.

For all testing purposes, we will be using py unittest framework, as it is straightforward with desired funtionality.
NOTE: '?=' implies default value

BLACK BOX TEST CASES

Testing: roll(die ?= 20)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that the returned roll value is between 1 and die, inclusive.
                    Verified by checking whether output is within desired bounds.
    Justification: Ensures all rolls performed by this method (and consequently others)
                   are valid, which is the base functionality for the entire module.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: When roll() or roll(die) is called.
    Correctness: Returned roll must be 1 <= roll <= die.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that roll() successfully flags an input error if parameters are invalid.
    Justification: Ensures that the user cannot accidentally pass incorrect arguments.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: When roll(die) is called where die is not an integer.
    Correctness: We expect the anticipated error message (see specs) along with 
                 an indicator that die is invalid.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: rollAdv(bool ?= True)
    Testing Case 1: Assert when called with no parameters, we roll with advantage.
    Justification: The most likely use case for this method is rolling with advantage,
                   so we default to True in the case that the user passes no arguments
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Call rollAdv() with no params or True
    Correctness: Returns a string with the roll results, returning the larger.
    Clean-Up: N/A

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert when called with False parameter, we roll with disadvantage.
    Justification: Occasionally a player will roll with disadvantage. We want to ensure
                   we are generating the correct roll.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Call rollAdv() with False argument.
    Correctness: Returns a string with the roll results, returning the lesser.
    Clean-Up: N/A

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 3: Assert that rollAdv() successfully flags an input error 
                    if parameters are invalid.
    Justification: Ensures that the user cannot accidentally pass incorrect arguments.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: When rollAdv(bool) is called where bool is not a boolean.
    Correctness: We expect the anticipated error message (see specs) along with 
                 an indicator that call is invalid.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: multiroll(die ?= 20, q ?= 1, mod ?= 0, fudge ?= 0)
    Testing Case 1: Assert output string is correct for any sequence of valid parameters.
    Justification: Our most used function, we want to ensure that a typical TTRPG roll
                   is correctly parsed and interpreted. Any integer values are acceptable.
                   (Who knows what wacky numbers a DM might want? Not us.)
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Call multiroll with varying parameter completeness 
                (ex. 4d10, d20+2, empty)
    Correctness: Correctly outputs formatted string with valid calculation.
    Clean-Up: N/A

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that multiroll() successfully flags an input error if 
                    and of the given parameters are invalid.
    Justification: Ensures that the user cannot accidentally pass incorrect arguments.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: When multiroll() is called where ANY of the params are non-integer.
    Correctness: We expect the anticipated error message (see specs) along with 
                 an indicator that any specific parameter is invalid.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 3: Assert that multiroll() successfully flags an input error if 
                    q, die are < 1.
    Justification: Ensures that the user cannot accidentally pass incorrect arguments.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: When multiroll() is called where q or die are less than 1.
    Correctness: We expect the anticipated error message (see specs) along with 
                 an indicator that any specific parameter is invalid.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: manualRoll(q, die, mod, roll)
    Testing Case 1: Assert output string is correct for any sequence of valid parameters.
    Justification: Some users prefer to use their own dice.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Call manualRoll() with all necessary params
    Correctness: Correctly outputs formatted string with result as 'roll'.
    Clean-Up: N/A
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: addMacro(q, die, mod, itemname)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that addMacro() successfully flags an input error if 
                    and of the given parameters are invalid.
    Justification: Ensures that the user cannot accidentally pass incorrect arguments.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: When addMacro() is called where ANY of the params other than itemname 
                are non-integer. Same for itemname not being a string.
    Correctness: We expect the anticipated error message (see specs) along with 
                 an indicator that any specific parameter is invalid.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: delMacro(itemname)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that delMacro() successfully flags an input error if 
                    itemname is not an int.
    Justification: We cant look for a key in the database if the key can't exist.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: When delMacro() is called where itemname is not a string.
    Correctness: We expect the anticipated error message (see specs) along with 
                 an indicator that any specific parameter is invalid.
    Clean-Up: None
    
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHITE BOX TEST CASES

Testing: multiroll(die ?= 20, q ?= 1, mod ?= 0, fudge ?= 0)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that a 4th parameter (fudge) successfully overrides the roll
                    without providing any indication of doing so.
    Justification: Fudge rolling is a valuable tool for a DM when discrete. We need
                   to ensure that adding the 4th parameter changes the behavior of the
                   function without showing the players.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Call multiroll with full parameter completeness AND a fudge > 0
                (ex. 1d20+4 24 will return 24 regardless of the roll)
    Correctness: Correctly outputs formatted string with fudge substituted for calculation.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: addMacro(q, die, mod, itemname)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that addMacro successfully adds a macro to the database.
    Justification: Macro tools are useful for players. We need to ensure that our database
                   ingestion successfully adds a properly formatted macro
    Special Set-Up: The database has no entry under itemname
    Generation: Calling addMacro() with full parameters
    Correctness: The database is populated with the new macro with arguments in the proper location.
    Clean-Up: delMacro(itemname)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that addMacro returns a dbError when called where itemname exists
    Justification: Items should be unique, so we can't allow collisions.
    Special Set-Up: The database should have an entry under itemname
    Generation: Calling addMacro() with itemname that exists
    Correctness: Should return a dberror indicating item exists already.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: delMacro(itemname)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that delMacro successfully removes an item
    Justification: Players may lose or sell items so we should be able to remove them.
    Special Set-Up: addMacro with itemname, params do not matter otherwise.
    Generation: Calling delMacro() with itemname
    Correctness: item should no longer exist in the database.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that delMacro returns a dbError when called where 
                    itemname does not exist
    Justification: We can't delete an item that isn't there.
    Special Set-Up: The database should have no entry under itemname
    Generation: Calling delMacro() with itemname not in database
    Correctness: Should return a dberror indicating item isn't there.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: inputError(params)
    Testing Case 1: Assert inputError is successfully able to indicate bad parameters.
    Justification: More specificity for the user is better in this context.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Calling inputError() with a list of parameters
    Correctness: inputError() will go through the list and return a string indicating issues
                 with provided parameters
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: inputError(params)
    Testing Case 1: Assert inputError is successfully able to indicate bad parameters.
    Justification: More specificity for the user is better in this context.
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Calling inputError() with a list of parameters
    Correctness: inputError() will go through the list and return a string indicating issues
                 with provided parameters
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Testing: dbError(key, itemname)
    Testing Case 1: Assert that dbError successfully indicates an item is already present
    Justification: Important functionality to help with addMacro().
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Calling dbError() with key set to True.
    Correctness: returns string indicating which key was already present.
    Clean-Up: None

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Testing Case 2: Assert that dbError successfully indicates an item does not exist
    Justification: Important functionality to help with delMacro().
    Special Set-Up: None
    Generation: Calling dbError() with key set to False.
    Correctness: returns string indicating which input key was not found.
    Clean-Up: None
