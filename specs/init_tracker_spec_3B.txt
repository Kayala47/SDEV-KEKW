PURPOSE: 

The purpose of this module is to cover the initiative
tracking requirements for common TTRPG games. The bot will
be able to use this module to add characters to the initiative
tracker with either a physically-rolled initiative or a
bot-rolled initiative, display the initiative order to the
text channel, keep track of rounds and the current turn, and
end combat by clearing the initiative tracker.

Variables:
    usernames - STRING ARRAY
    names - STRING ARRAY
    inits - INT ARRAY
    round - INT
    currentPlayer - INT

Function JOIN(username, name, init)
    possible returns: none
    inputs: username - STRING
            name - STRING
            init - INT
    logic: adds "username, name, init" into
           database, sorting from highest to
           lowest init value.
    error handling: calls ERR if name is non-string,
                    init is non-int, or if name already
                    exists in the database
    comments: This function is in charge of adding a
              character into the initiative order. The
              Dungeon Master can also add creatures in
              this way.

Function BEGIN()
    possible returns: usernames - ARRAY
                      names - ARRAY
                      inits - ARRAY
    inputs: none
    logic: loop through database to generate
           usernames, names, and inits; sets round = 1;
           sets currentPlayer = 0
    error handling: calls ERR if database is empty
    comments: Discussion needs to be had on the best
              way for BEGIN to output the information
              to be displayed by the bot interface, but
              in this way, only the index needs to be
              kept track of for the purposes of NEXT and PREV.

Function END()
    possible returns: none
    inputs: none
    logic: clear the database; set round = 0
    error handling: calls ERR if database cannot
                    be cleared correctly, or BEGIN
                    hasn't been called yet
    comments: This should be called at the end of combat.

Function NEXT()
    possible returns: string
    inputs: none
    logic: change global variable index to next
           player in the initiative order and return
           their details (username, name, init) as well
           as the round number, also a global variable;
           calls INC_ROUND() if currentPlayer = 0.
    error handling: calls ERR if database is empty
    comments: This is called by the bot interface
              when mesage.awaitReact("EMOJI") gets
              triggered by the "next" emoji.

Function PREV()
    possible returns: string
    inputs: none
    logic: change global variable index to previous
           player in the initiative order and return
           their details (username, name, init) as well
           as the round number, also a global variable;
           calls DEC_ROUND() if currentPlayer is length-1
           of the names array.
    error handling: calls ERR if database is empty
    comments: This is called by the bot interface
              when mesage.awaitReact("EMOJI") gets
              triggered.

Function INCR_ROUND()
    possible returns: round - INT
    inputs: none
    logic: increment global variable round by 1
    error handling: N/A

Function DEC_ROUND()
    possible returns: round - INT
    inputs: none
    logic: decrement global variable round by 1
    error handling: if round-1 < 1, sets round = 1 and
                    calls ERR
