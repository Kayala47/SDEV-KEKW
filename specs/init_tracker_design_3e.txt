PURPOSE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this module is to cover the initiative
tracking requirements for common TTRPG games. The bot will
be able to use this module to add characters to the initiative
tracker with either a physically-rolled initiative or a
bot-rolled initiative, display the initiative order to the
text channel, keep track of rounds and the current turn, and
end combat by clearing the initiative tracker. This module
will be a class; the Bot Interface module will store an
instance of an initiative tracker, allowing persistent storage
of the tracker information.

	# order needs to be sent to the Discord server.
