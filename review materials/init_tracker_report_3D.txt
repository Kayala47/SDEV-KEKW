Design Review

Time: 6:00 PM, Sunday, November 8, 2020

Module: Initiative Tracker

Attendees: Swamik, Max, Kevin, Dana

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SPECIFICATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUST FIX
- Issue: Database is too complex.
    - We will be able to provide a more elegant solution to storing the user
      information for the initiative tracker if we use something simpler.
    - A suggestion was made to use a circular linked list stored in the initiative
      tracker object.

- Defect: Error function is missing.
    - Ensure that output is written in a nice format.


SHOULD FIX
- Issue: All functions are in upper-case.
    - We need to follow an agreed upon convention for functions, to ensure code
      readability.
    - We suggest using lower-case, as used in the initiative module design and
      testing plan.


COMMENTS
- Question: What imports will be needed for this module, if any?

- Question: How will the bot interface interact with the initiative tracker module
            for outputs?
    - We suggest updating the initiative tracker object dynamically, so there will
      be a new representation of the initiative order rather than creating a
      completely new object.
    - Pass object to interface.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DESIGN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUST FIX
- Issue: How will the initiative tracker module interact with the bot interface?
    - Discussions need to be had regarding what will be passed to the initiative
      tracker module, and what will be returned.
    - Discussions need to be had regarding the initiative tracker object, and where
      that is stored.

SHOULD FIX
- Issue: Object attributes need to be clarified.
    - They aren't very clear in their function when introduced.
    - Add comments to make this easier to understand.


COMMENTS
- Question: The pseudocode is Java-esque; will you translate this into Python at a
            later time?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTING PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUST FIX
- Defect: Pyunit
    - Must be mentioned and explained.

- Issue: Initial creation of CSV file.
    - We suggest doing away with CSV file, and working with circular linked list
      instead, as discussed in the specifications.

SHOULD FIX
- Question: Is it possible to have combat with only one character?
    - No, but this should be justified in the testing plan.

COMMENTS
- Question: What is meant by "integration testing is separate"?
    - Bot interface needs to be working before integration testing can be
      determined.
    - Testing plan for integration needs to be agreed upon once discussions have
      been had.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the submitted specifications, design, and testing plan for the initiative
tracker module, we approve the module with required changes. The main points for
specifications were the nature of the database and the missing error function. The
main points for the design was the interaction between this module and the bot
interface, where discussions still need to take place. The main points for the
testing plan were the mention and justification of using pyunit, and addressing the
initial creation of the CSV file, if that's still the route the group will take.
From the meeting, it seems that they need to discuss the interactions between the
modules in order to make the necessary changes, but should be reasonably simple
after those discussions have been had. For this reason, we believe that once the
necessary changes are made, this module will be ready to be approved.
