BOT INTERFACE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- PREFIX LIST: Will we have a list of valid prefixes, or just one that the user
               can change using "!prefix [prefix]"? (Prefix overlap with other bots
               could pose an issue here.)

- NORMAL ROLL: What is the default for "!roll" if there are no parameters given? (I
               think it should be 1d20, since that is the most common roll in
               TTRPGs like D&D.)

               Does subtraction work for negative stat mods? (eg. "!roll 1d20 -2")

               Will we be showing the format of their roll in our embedded output?
               (eg. "!roll 1d20 +2" might show as "1d20(17) + 2 = 19", allowing the
               user to make sure they inputed their command correctly.)

               What about advantage / disadvantage rolls?

- FUDGE ROLL: Should we be returning an error message or return nothing when fudge
              roll isn't given any parameters? (I think we should have a way to let
              the user know that they wrote it incorrectly without letting the
              other players know that a fudge roll was attempted.)

- INITIATIVE: You will need to pass the username of the user that is trying
               to join, so that you can tag them when it's their turn.

               Will the initiative tracker module need to have two different join
               functions, to account for modifier and roll? (Both are integers, so
               I'd need to have a boolean to flag which one is being used.)

               The way the initiative tracker module works at the moment, it
               assumes that the bot interface has a pointer to an initiative
               tracker object, which the initiative tracker module updates. Will
               this work with the current bot interface design? (I suspect we will
               need to have further discussions about this.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROLLING MODULE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ROLL: What is the default for "!roll" if there are no parameters given? The bot
        interface seems to call roll().

- ADD MACRO: Are the macros global? Do all players have access to it?

             What happens if you attempt to add a macro with the same name as an
             existing macro?

- MULTIROLL: Will this module allow for the functionality of calling
             "!multiroll 2d8 + 3d6 + 2"? This is a matter of linking the
             functionality of the bot interface and the rolling module.

- MANUAL ROLL: Will this be used for fudging, as well? (I think we should flag
               manual rolls in the output, but not fudge rolls.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPENDIUM MODULE
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SEARCH: Currently, the interaction between the bot interface and the compendium
          module using the search function doesn't narrow by spell, race,
          background, and feat.

          Will this work for mobile as well as desktop? (Formatting may be
          different, which could pose potential issues for the webscraper. Some
          users will be using the mobile app version of Discord.)

- EDIT DISTANCE: Purpose of editDistance(string s1, string s2) is a little unclear.
