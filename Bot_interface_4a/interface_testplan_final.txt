Note: The primary funcitons of this module is to ensure that the bot is both reading  
the commands of the user and then is parsing the message correctly so that the calls to 
the modules are with the correct inputs. If I were to rely on the implimentations of the 
other modules to test my module, it would not be ideal as I cannot test my module in 
isolation. As such, I decided to make my own test version dummy command execution 
commands that would marely record the params that were passed and compare the recorded 
function and and params with those that should have been passed given the input string. 

To do testing for this process, and to make it slightly more autonomous, a new section of code 
will either be added to the orginal DnD bot or a new seperate testing bot will be made so that we can 
send messages to the chat channel. In the testing module, instead of calling the functions from the 
other modules, I will call a dummy test function within my own module that just records all of the inputs that was 
passed to that function. The correctness criteria will then be that the dummy function in my module 
is getting the correct inputs based on the user's input. Essentially we need to ensure that the functions in my 
module are correctly parsing the user's input string and giving each function the correct inputs based 
on the user's input string. 

The way to make this fully autonomous is to use the pytest feature of assert. For each funciton in the module, 
I can assert that the inputs for each of the functions are correctly parsed by comapring what the actual parsing 
is supposed to get vs. what the function actually got. 
For Example: assert roll(("2d20", "+5")) == [2,20,+5] 
In this case, the dummy roll testing function is storing all the inputs as a list in a certain order, and I can check that it is correct. 

------------------------------------------------CHANGES FROM 3E-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The reason that i am using tuples is that when we pull user message from discord, it gives it to us in the form of tuples of strings. 
To emulate that, we will be giving the commands that actually listen to user input, inputs in the form of tuples. Previously, I had thought 
that the inputs would be strings, which is not the case. 

During the implimentation of the roll funciton, there were multiple helper functions needed to make the parsing look cleaner rather than if 
we had included all of the parsing in one funcion. As such, we will have to add the testing for those helper functions: getSideDie, 
getModifier, getModifierWithFudge, hasFudge, getFudgeValue. These funcitons are called within the roll functions and are given the 
inputs as strings becasue in the begining of the roll funcion, we convert the tuple input into strings. 

The rollAdv function originally took in a string of either "True" or "False", but now we have changed it to take in no inputs. We did this 
becasue we chose to add another funciton called rollDisadv which would take care of the false case of the original rollAdv. The changed functions
have no inputs and require no parsing so there are only blackbox tests that can be done. 

For all of the initive tracker functions, begin(), end(), next(), previous(), show(), we did not have tests for them as they were just doing an 
action to the initive tracker object, and not any user parsing, we will now just add simple tests to these functinos to make sure that 
they were called. 

In the previous implimentaion for Join and addMacro, I had believed that we could get the specific params that the user was missing, but 
because of how discord is handing data, there is no way to check which specific data that the user is missing. As such, we will slightly 
change the function to look at the amount of inputs the user gave and how many are missing. For example if addMacro needs 4 inputs, 
we will have a diff error if they inputed 3 inputs vs 2 inputs. 

The specifications for search has changed slightly, I had misunderstood that the serach would take in just two key words, but I was 
later told that it can take multiple keywords as inputs. As such, the function should now return a list of all the keywords that the user 
inputed rather than just two key words. This means that there is a change to the testing of search.

BLACK BOX TESTING

Testing: help() //no inputs 

    Testing Case 1: Assert that the message returned by the help function is the correct message that we have wrote for the 
                    help function. Since there is no parsing done here, it will be a simple assertion that two strings are the 
                    same. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the help feature, they are getting the correct string returned to them. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: When help() is called 
    Correctness: The string returned matches the string that we originally wrote for the help function. 
    Clean Up: None 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing: multiroll(die, q, mod, fudge) 
Note: The function of the multiroll function in this module is to just insure that the users are passing the correct amount of inputs, 
we are not actually checking the valididty of the inputs, as that is handeled by the rolling module. Meaning to our function call  
of !multiroll HidBye should record the inputs as ["Hi", "Bye"], we do not ensure that the inputs are ints as the rolling module handels that. 

    Testing Case 1: Calling the multiroll function with no inputs. If the user calls the roll with no inputs, the function should just 
                    call the roll function with no inputs. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the roll feature no inputs, the bot still understands to call the multiroll function. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: multiroll is called 
    Correctness: The list of inputs returned from the dummy function that records the inputs matches [] (an empty list). We will do a simple 
                 assertion that [] == to the call to the dummy roll funciton. 
    Clean Up: None 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Testing Case 2: Calling the multiroll function with 2 inputs: the side of die and the number of die. If the user calls the roll with 
                    the input of xdy, the call to the roll function should record that the inputs are x and y. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the roll feature in the form xdy with no modifier, the bot still understands to call the 
                   multiroll function with the given inputs. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: When multiroll is called 
    Correctness: The list of inputs returned from the dummy function that records the inputs matches ["x", "y"]. We will do a simple 
                 assertion that ["x", "y"] == to the call to the dummy roll funciton. 
    Clean Up: None 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Testing Case 3: Calling the multiroll function with 3 inputs: the side of die, the number of die, and modifier. If the user calls the 
                    roll with the input of xdy + m, the call to the roll function should record that the inputs are x,y, and m. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the roll feature in the form xdy + m, the bot still understands to call the 
                   multiroll function with the given inputs. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: When multiroll is called 
    Correctness: The list of inputs returned from the dummy function that records the inputs matches ["x", "y", "m"]. We will do a simple 
                 assertion that ["x", "y", "m"] == to the call to the dummy roll funciton. 
    Clean Up: None 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Testing Case 4: Calling the multiroll function with 4 inputs: the side of die, the number of die, modifier, and the fudge roll. If the 
                    user calls the roll with the input of xdy + m f, the call to the roll function should record that the inputs are x,y,m, 
                    and f. We want the users to have all the inputs for the fudge roll to look similar to a multiroll because we do not want the 
                    other players to know that the user is doing a fudge roll. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the roll feature in the form xdy + m f, the bot still understands to call the 
                   multiroll function with the given inputs. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: When multiroll is called 
    Correctness: The list of inputs returned from the dummy function that records the inputs matches ["x", "y", "m", "f"]. We will do a simple 
                 assertion that [["x", "y", "m", "f"] == to the call to the dummy roll funciton.

Testing: rollAdv ()

    Testing Case 1: Calling the rollAdv function with no inputs. This should call the rollAdv function and return a string 
                    saying that the rollAdv function was called. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the rollAdv feature, it correctly understands the call. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: When rollAdv is called 
    Correctness: The string returned matches the string that we originally wrote for the rollAdv function.

                    saying that the rollDisadv function was called. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the rollDisadv feature, it correctly understands the call. 
    Special Set Up: N/A

    Correctness: The string returned matches the string that we originally wrote for the rollDisadv function.

Testing: manualRoll(die, q, mod, rollResult) 

    Testing Case 1: Calling the manualRoll function with no inputs. If the user calls the roll with no inputs, the function should send 
                    an error message. 
        Justification: Ensures that when users use the manualroll feature no inputs, the bot still understands that it is a call to the 
                       multiroll function, but realizes that it is an error. 
        Special Set Up: N/A 
        Generation: manualRoll is called 
        Correctness: The string returned matches the string that we originally wrote for the error message in the manual roll function. 
        Clean Up: None 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Testing Case 2: Calling the manualRoll function with with 4 inputs: the side of die, the number of die, modifier, and the rollResult. 
                    If the user calls the roll with the input of xdy + m r, the call to the manualroll function should record that the inputs 
                    are x,y,m, and r. We want the users to have all the inputs for the manual roll to look similar to a multiroll. 
            Justification: Ensures that when users use the manualroll feature with the correct amount of inputs, the bot  understands 
                        that it is a call to the manualroll function. 
            Special Set Up: N/A 
            Generation: manualRoll is called 
            Correctness: The list of inputs returned from the dummy function that records the inputs matches ["x", "y", "m", "r"]. We will do 
                         a simple assertion that ["x", "y", "m", "r"] == to the call to the dummy roll funciton.

                    an error message. 
        Justification: Ensures that when users use the manualroll feature no inputs, the bot still understands that it is a call to the 
                       addMacro function, but realizes that it is an error. 
        Special Set Up: N/A

                    of die q mod name, the call to the addMacro function should record that the inputs are die, q, mod, and name. 
            Justification: Ensures that when users use the addMacfo feature with the correct amount of inputs, the bot  understands 
                           that it is a call to the manualroll function.

                    function is the correct message that we have wrote for the delMacro function. Since there is no parsing done here, 
                    it will be a simple assertion that two strings are the same. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the delMacro feature, an error is shown if they have no inputs.

WHITE BOX TESTS 

The mojority of the white box testing in this module will be for testing for errors in the user inputs. The logic in my design is structured 
so that after I parse the user's inputs, I have a series of checks to see which specific param that the user is missing so that I can give a 
more specific error message. 

Testing: multiroll(die, q, mod, fudge) 

    Testing Case 1: Calling the multiroll function with necessary inputs missing. Meaning the two essential things needed for multiroll are 
                    x and y if the roll is in the form xdy. If the user inputs a x but not a y, it is a seperate error than if the user inputs 
                    a y and not an x. We have conditional statements in place to check for both cases, and in the two different cases we have different 
                    error messages. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the multiroll feature with missing key inputs, the bot still understands which specific error it is and returns 
                   the correct error message. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: multiroll is called 
    Correctness: The error message returned matches the error message it was supposed to send. Meaning if I am missing the x parameter, it will send an 
                 error message saying that I am missing the x param, not an error message saying that I am missing the y param. This is a simple assertion that 
                 the two strings are matching. 
    Clean Up: None 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing: manualRoll(die, q, mod, rollResult) 

    Testing Case 1: Calling the manualRoll function with necessary inputs missing. The 4 essential inputs needed for manualRoll are 
                    x,y,m,r if the roll is in the form xdy + m r. For manual rolls the user needs to have all 4 inputs. If the user inputs a 
                    x but not y,m,r, there will be a seperate error than if the user inputs a y and not an x. We have conditional statements in 
                    place to check for the different cases. For each case there is a specific error message in place. We need to check that all of 
                    the conditions will get passed and we get the right errorrs. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the manualRoll feature with missing key inputs, the bot still understands which specific error it is and returns 
                   the correct error message. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: manualRoll is called 
    Correctness: The error message returned matches the error message it was supposed to send. Meaning if I am missing the x parameter, it will send an 
                 error message saying that I am missing the x param, not an error message saying that I am missing the y param. This is a simple assertion that 
                 the two strings are matching.

Testing: addMacro(die, q, mod, name) 

    Testing Case 1: Calling the addMacro function with necessary inputs missing. The 4 essential inputs needed for addMacro are 
                    d,q,m,n if the call is in the form addMacro die q mod name. For addMacro the user needs to have all 4 inputs. If the user inputs a 
                    d but not q,m,n, there will be a seperate error than if the user inputs a q and not an d. We have conditional statements in 
                    place to check for the different cases. For each case there is a specific error message in place. We need to check that all of 
                    the conditions will get passed and we get the right errorrs. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the addMacro feature with missing key inputs, the bot still understands which specific error it is and returns 
                   the correct error message. 
    Special Set Up: N/A 
    Generation: addMacro is called 
    Correctness: The error message returned matches the error message it was supposed to send. Meaning if I am missing the x parameter, it will send an 
                 error message saying that I am missing the q param, not an error message saying that I am missing the d param. This is a simple assertion that 
                 the two strings are matching.

Testing: join(username, name, init) 

    Testing Case 1: Calling the join function with necessary inputs missing. The 3 essential inputs needed for join are 
                    u,n,i if the call is in the form join username name init. For join the user needs to have all 3 inputs. If the user inputs a 
                    u but not n,i, there will be a seperate error than if the user inputs a i and not an u. We have conditional statements in 
                    place to check for the different cases. For each case there is a specific error message in place. We need to check that all of 
                    the conditions will get passed and we get the right errorrs. 
    Justification: Ensures that when users use the join feature with missing key inputs, the bot still understands which specific error it is and returns
