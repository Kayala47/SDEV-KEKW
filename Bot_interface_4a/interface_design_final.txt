PURPOSE: 

The purpose of this module is to handel the user inputs and to act as the user interface. As such, the purpose of 
most of the functions in this module will be getting the user input ready for calls to other modules, and how to 
handel invalid inputs. The functions described are public methods and the only way for users to interact with out bot. 

All of the functions below listen to user input using discord's built in methods. The primary listening mechanism 
will be the bot.on('message', ...). What this built in function does is listen to all of the messages written by all 
of the users in the text chanel. Then if the message starts with the chosen prefix, it will know that it is a command. Then 
depending on what the command is it will do a different functon. 

------------------------------------------------CHANGES MADE SINCE PART 3E------------------------------------------------
- Add macro: 
    - Due to how we are receiving the inputs from discord, we cannot check for each individual inputs as we do not 
      know which input the user was trying to make. So we now just have one error that says that the user does not 
      have all of the correct inputs. 
- Join: 
    - same as AddMacro, we cannot be certain of what filed the users were missing so we will just have one error. 
    - Now the function takes in the initive roll instead of a modifier for the roll 
- Search: 
    - Misunderstanding of the integration. The user can call search with much more than just 2 key words, as such 
      there is a change of inputs and outputs. The user needs to have an input of at least 2, rather than a max of 
      2 inputs. As such, we are now passing a whole list of keywords to search rather than just two keywords. 
-Initive Tracker new functions 
    - We are no longer adding an emoji listeing function to the begin function. Now there will be seperate commands 
      that the user can use to progress the initive tracker.(Next and previous) These functions got added. 
    - We also added a new function called show which will just show the current initivie tracker 
- Added a new functions for the macros: showMacros and deleteMacros 
- rollAdv no longer takes in an input, it is going to be a call with no inputs 
    - Insted of passing in a true or false for rollAdv, we added another function called rollDisadv
- Code structure: 
    - We are now using bot on command rather than on message. This means that the bot is no longer looking at every 
      message, rather it gets activated if the user only places the commands that is defined in the bot interface
