The component being reviewed during this session was the rolling module code,
which includes code for testing and functionality for the rolling portion. 
This supports dice rolling, item tracking, macro storage, and item usage within
player games. Testing is black box with the exception of macro handling, which
requires insight into how the items are being stored to test correct functionality.
